To use this package you need to have slang (2.2.3 or higher), LaTeX,
and xfig installed.

Installing the package involves running the configure script, then
running `make`, followed by `make install`.  The configure script has
two important options:

   --prefix=/installation-path-prefix

       This specifies path-prefix for the slxfig package

   --with-slang=/prefix-for-slang-2

       This option is used to specify where slang-2 is located.  If
       this option is unspecified, the argument specified for --prefix
       will be used.

For example, suppose that slang-2 is installed under /usr/local, and
that you wish to install the slxfig package under /home/bob/soft/.  Then
run the configure script via:

   ./configure --prefix=/home/bob/soft --with-slang=/usr/local

This will cause the slxfig package to be installed in

   /home/bob/soft/lib/slang/v2/modules/
   /home/bob/soft/share/slsh/local-packages/

Since in this case the installation directory is different from the
slang location, slsh will not be able to find the slxfig package
unless told where to look.  The standard mechanism for doing this is
to add:

  append_to_slang_load_path("/home/bob/soft/share/slsh/local-packages");
  set_import_module_path (get_import_module_path()
                          + ":/home/bob/soft/lib/slang/v2/modules);

to your ~/.slshrc file.

Now type make to create the package:

   make

Assuming this step was successful, install it:

   make install

To test the installation, try building some of the examples in the
examples directory.
